  title: Living Mummy
  text: "Once upon a time, Seth woke up bored and decided to kill Osiris. A God killing
    a God is usually not that big of a deal, because the killing can be easily reversed:
    provided, of course, that the target's body is in one piece. Seth took that into
    account, and dismembered Osiris's corpse, spreading the pieces all across the
    realm. With a lot of team effort, Isis and Nephthys managed to gather all the
    pieces and invent mummification to put Osiris back together. Osiris is alive
    now, but they decided to keep the mummy thing on just in case.\r"
