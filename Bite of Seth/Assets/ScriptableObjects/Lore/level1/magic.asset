  title: The Sorceress Supreme
  text: "Isis is a powerhouse of raw magic! She usually uses her powers to protect:
    protect soldiers in war, protect Ra against Aphopis, protect Osiris against Seth,
    protect Horus against Seth (before he had the power to protect himself, which
    is also her doing), protect human souls until the judgment, protect everyone!
    She also has a lot of utility spells: illusions, transmutations, enchantments,
    which she uses to outsmart other Gods every now and then... I mean, she is the
    Goddess of Magic and Wisdom for a reason!\r"
