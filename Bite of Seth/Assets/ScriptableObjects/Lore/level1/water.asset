  title: 'The Boat Fleet '
  text: "Wepwawet is the best boat conductor of all the Pantheon, this title comes
    from experience: initially, he was the one in charge of conducting every single
    dead human soul to Anubis judgement, which was quite a lot of work to be honest,
    and it got worse when Ra decided to start making his Journey on a boat. Of course
    the God of the Sun deserves only the best, according to himself. That made Wepwawet
    to design an entire boat route system and hire thousands of spirits, who were
    looking for a job, to conduct the souls at his command.\r"
