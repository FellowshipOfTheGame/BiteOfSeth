  title: Journey of Ra
  text: "What the God of the Sun does when the moon is up in the sky? Well... he
    stays dead: every single day Ra dies at Sunset and reborn at Sunrise, with the
    help of Khepri. While dead, his body is carried by Wepwawet\u2019s boat through
    all the 12 realms of the night. Some of them are districts of other entities,
    some of them are lairs for dead souls, but every single one has snakes for some
    reason. "
