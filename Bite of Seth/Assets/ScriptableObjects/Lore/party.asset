  title: Rhythm of the Night
  text: "The souls who pass Anubis Judgement find home at Osiris Realm of the Dead,
    which is a nice and peaceful place to stay for eternity, but sometimes that post
    live can be a little boring. Any soul who feels this way is invited to the Party
    of the Dead Kings, an event that takes place on another Realm of the Night organized
    by Bes and Nepra. Originally this Realm was just the eternal rest of all the
    rulers of Ancient Egypt but\u2026 well\u2026 kings like to party!"
