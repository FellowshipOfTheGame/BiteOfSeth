  text: 'There is a conspiracy theory running around that Beset is just Bes dressed
    as a woman just to pretend he is married. But that is not true. Actually, for
    a long time was the other way around: distracted with humanity festivities, Bes
    stopped taking care of some families. So Beset started to dress as Bes and fill
    that gap, without him knowing. Eventually Bes met Beset and started to believe
    she was a female version of him. Well, he still believes on it. '
