  text: It took time to the Pantheon to have any agriculture. Osiris took the job
    for a while and Nepra was his assistant at the time. But after Osisis death,
    Nepra was not very on the mood to farm and harvest... Until humankind figured
    out that you can make drinks out of grains. Thanks to that, we now have a pretty
    efficient, self motivated and brewing expert God of Grains.
