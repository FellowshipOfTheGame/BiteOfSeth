  title: A Brillant Bill
  text: 'Thoth is a God really full of himself, but lest be honest, the guy is really
    smart! Also, the God of Wisdom have a talent on poking his bill into someone
    else''s business: Amun was creating the world and Thoth was the God of the Moon
    at the time but he really got into what his friend was doing! He designed rules
    for science... religion... philosophy... magic... and pitched all to Amun, who
    refused, because Thoth''s system requires a 365-day year to work and the year
    was 360 day long at the time. Instead of accepting a "no", Thoth somehow exploited
    Amun''s current rules and started gambling with the moon for 5 days (and won).
    Amun didn''t realised what was happening until the year started having 365 days
    and Thoth appeared again at his door.'
