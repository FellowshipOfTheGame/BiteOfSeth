  text: 'Sleeping on the Pantheon is something a little more... extreme: one thousand
    years is considered "a little nap". Actually, Gods are dead more often then at
    sleep weirdly enough, but hey! Since naps are off the schedule, Gods have a little
    special drink that help them to keep awake and working: Coffee. Some entities
    are discussing about sharing this delicious and energetic drink on humans to
    see the effects, but Wadjet is strongly against it! For... safety reasons...
    of course...'
