  text: Once upon a time, Ra decided to be the Pharaoh himself, but that did not
    work do well and of course Ra blamed human kind for everything. So the Sun God
    turned the kind Hathor into the violent Sekhmet just to scare everyone. Let's
    just say... that went out of control. Ra couldn't just turned her back, but a
    couple entities managed to give Hathor some kind of control. Sometimes she have
    her crisis, but humanity is alive so far, so problem solved!
