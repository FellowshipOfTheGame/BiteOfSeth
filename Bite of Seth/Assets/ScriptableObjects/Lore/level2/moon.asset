  title: Eye of the Moon
  text: 'The Eye of Ra was basically a fancy name that Ra used to call his assistant
    and was a position occupied by many Goddess in history. Nowadays, all of them
    have their own jobs but they formed a Bodyguard team to protect Ra on nightime.
    Technically, we do have an Eye of Ra now: his daughter, Bastet. She represents
    the moon and is literally there to watch everything while Ra is dead, so that
    would be the first time that the title "Eye of Ra" would actually makes sense!
    But Bastet hates this title, because she doesn''t want to be remembered as just
    "Ra''s Daughter", so no one but Ra uses it.'
