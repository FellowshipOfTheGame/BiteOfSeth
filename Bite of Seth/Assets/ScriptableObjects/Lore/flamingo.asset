  title: Bird From Another Land
  text: "Isis usually helps Serket fight the giant snake Apophis, mostly because
    no one else wants to, but they aren\u2019t the only entities there: a magic pink
    bird carrying some roasted meat skewered on a wood stick eventually appears on
    the battlefield, not to help, but to watch and cheer as if the battle was some
    kind of sport. It always brings a strange sweet and endless black liquid full
    of bubbles on a glass vessel and keeps drinking during all the fight. No one
    knows if this bird is from another realm or even another time, but it always
    comes once each seven days and stays close to Ra, so eventually it got the name
    of Sunday Grill Flamingo.\r"
