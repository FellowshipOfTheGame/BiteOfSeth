  text: "As the gatekeeper of the Afterlife, Anubis received the job of designing
    a trial to decide if a given deceased human should enter Osiris\u2019 Aaru or
    get devoured by Ammit. Of course, by \u201Ctrial\u201D they meant some sort of
    \u201Cfinal test\u201D, but Anubis being Anubis took it to a literal sense: balancing
    the defendant\u2019s heart against a feather that belongs to the LITERAL PERSONIFICATION
    OF41 TRUTH, while 42 CAREFULLY CHOSEN ASSESSORS would listen to the defendant\u2019s
    case."
