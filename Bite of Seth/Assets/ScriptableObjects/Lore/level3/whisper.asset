  text: "While Amun was building everything that exists and Thoth was nitpicking,
    Ptah was the artistic voice of the world\u2019s creation. Nowadays he is constantly
    crafting things and coming up with new ideas, including a certain social experiment
    that involves humans being able to communicate with Gods. The access was restricted
    to priests and the Pharaoh family only for playtest, but after today that idea
    will probably get some revisions.\r"
