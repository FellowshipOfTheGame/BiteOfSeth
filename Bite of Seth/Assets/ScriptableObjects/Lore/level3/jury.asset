  text: "The Assessors of Maat are a group of 42 deities summoned every Heart Weight
    trial to listen to and verify the defendant\u2019s negative confessions. This
    group was assembled because Maat wasn\u2019t much in the mood of doing it herself
    on each and every trial. Partially because she prefers to preserve the truth
    without interacting with it, partially because there are 42 CONFESSIONS TO VERIFY.
    EVERY TIME SOMEONE DIES."
