  title: War of Mockery
  text: "Despite being a little too serious for his own good (and for the good of
    almost anyone who interacts with him), Anhur surprisingly loves a good mock battle!
    Which makes things both better and worse. On one hand, that\u2019s an excellent
    way to break the silence. On the other hand, get carried away and you will have
    to deal with his second obsession: defending honor."
