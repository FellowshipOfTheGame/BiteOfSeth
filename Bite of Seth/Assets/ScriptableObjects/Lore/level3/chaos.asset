  title: "The Chaos\u2019 Wife"
  text: "Nephthys occupies an interesting spot of the Egyptian Pantheon. She is married
    to Seth and has no moral problem with anything he does, yet she is always there
    to help fix everything later and doesn\u2019t have interest in causing any harm
    herself. Nephthys is actually well received everywhere: festivities, funerals,
    healing rituals\u2026 Some theories say that her connection with Iris is what
    keeps her in line, others say that she just likes to have good stories to tell."
