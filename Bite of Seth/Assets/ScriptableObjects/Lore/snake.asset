  title: 'Tireless Snake '
  text: "Apophis is also known as The Snake of Chaos but, despite similar titles,
    he doesn\u2019t work to the God of Chaos. Actually, they hate each other: Apophis
    is still just an entity and does not get promoted to God because Seth is already
    in charge, so he always tries to cause trouble to prove himself as a chaotic
    more competent. That behavior made the Pantheon trap him in one of the Realms
    of the Night, where he still causes some trouble as an Eater of Souls. Sometimes
    he tries to reach Ra\u2019s boat and attack him, but all he gets is a fight with
    his younger sister, Serket."
